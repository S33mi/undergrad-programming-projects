**HTML/CSS** (Front end version)


Features (common): User registration/login, flight search, booking, cancellation, Home, About, Contact, admin panel.

<!-- ### 3. Airline Reservation System (Front end HTML/CSS), Java + C# Web Applications) 

**Java version** (likely Swing + JDBC or JSP/Servlets + MySQL)  

**C# version** (likely ASP.NET MVC/Core or WinForms + SQL Server) 



Features (common):  User registration/login, flight search, booking, cancellation, admin panel, database integration.



Technologies:

- Java: (Swing/JSP/Servlets/Spring?) + MySQL/JDBC

- C#: ASP.NET (Web Forms/MVC/Core?) + SQL Server -->

These projects demonstrate:

- Strong fundamentals in C++, Frontend development

- OOP design & code structure

- File

- Console & Frontend + web UI development

- Complete application logic



All code is from my undergrad coursework/practice — cleaned up for public sharing.
